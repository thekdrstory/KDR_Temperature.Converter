# Temperature Converter app
A simple app for converting a chosen temperature to different scales.

This is a simple lightweight application created in c# that asks the user to input any number and spits out all possible temperatures associated with the reference.
This allows for the ability, at a glance, to see all the possible configurations that depend on what temperature scale the number is paired with.

I created this application because I did not feel like rummaging through drop list downs and having to swap the chosen temperatues scales to match what scale my number was in.
I just wanted to type in a number and see it all laid out before me.
